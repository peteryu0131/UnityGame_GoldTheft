For my C# 3D Unity Game “Gold Theft”. 
It is an engaging game inspired by the Super Mario franchise and challenges players to deftly control their character's movements using keyboard inputs across various levels. 
This captivating gameplay demands adept jumping between floors, evasion of treacherous monsters, and the collection of gold coins to advance to subsequent stages. 
The game's immersive soundtrack features distinct melodies and sound effects, enriching the overall experience.
Combining addictive gameplay and a rich auditory landscape, Gold Theft delivers a stimulating and gratifying gaming experience that tests users' reflexes and strategic prowess.
Among the game's core scripts, the "WaypointFollower" script moves a game object along a specified path defined by an array of waypoints while continuously checking the object's distance to set the next target. 
The "PlayerLife" script handles the player's life and death, detecting the player's position and collisions, calling the "Die" function, and reloading the scene after a short delay when the player dies. 
The "ItemCollector" script allows the player to collect coins, detecting collisions with game objects tagged as coins and updating the UI text and sound effects when coins are collected. 
Finally, the "PlayerMovement" script enables the movement and jumping of the game object, detecting player input, and adjusting the object's movement speed and jump height.
It also enables the player to destroy enemies by jumping on them, providing a satisfying element to the gameplay.
